#Artificial - Neural Network - Storyteller

*If this can be even one of the simplest prototype of an "artificial storyteller", I would be glad.*

 - Keyword to Story
 - Video context recognition UI
 - movie analyzer
 - video dialog enhancer.
 
 a. An auto-reading of text to voice by a python program such as espeak.
 b. Utilize auto-generate music synth and basses from notes of alphabet if possible. or Emotions. maybe both and measure. 
 c. Understanding "context" of the content (Image Classification for generatigng context images), generate sub-categories, scales, best possible evaluation and randomisation theories.
 d. Generating search queries to look images, even videos if possible.
 e. Utilize image editing capabilities of python and generate artwork from coming context related images of content that spoken in text.
 f. Auto-generate a video show by post-produced images, generated by content text, music, quotes.
 
 *environment recognition and description from image.
  event recoqnition and description from image.
  metamind demo. RNTN sentiment analysis. InSight SDK 3.2. Torch*
  
 Iterations and survey for search - result during process. Icon/Vector/Art/Image search from API. Portraits for character detection, Image placement for detected Quotation.
